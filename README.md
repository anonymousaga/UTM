# UTM
My UTM virtual machines.

See packages for released VMs. They are zipped with 7z by Keka (it's a great app!).

Notes on each machine:

 - Ubuntu 4.10: Internet, sound, mouse, keyboard, clock, and GUI work. The VM does not have seamless transition for mouse. Resolution: 1024 x 768, colored
 - Windows 95: Internet, sound, mouse, keyboard, clock, and GUI work. The VM does not have seamless transition for mouse. Resolution: 640 x 480, 16 colors
