# UTM
My UTM virtual machines.

See packages for released VMs. Each release is a new VM (so no concept of latest/earliest, I will edit a release if it needs changes). They are zipped with 7z by Keka (it's a great app!).

Notes on each machine:

 - Ubuntu 4.10: Internet, sound, mouse, keyboard, clock, and GUI work. The VM does not have seamless transition for mouse. Resolution: 1024 x 768, colored
 - Windows 95: Internet, sound, mouse, keyboard, clock, and GUI work. The VM does not have seamless transition for mouse. Resolution: 640 x 480, 16 colors

If you have any suggestions on better ways to organize this (my 7z files will almost always be more than 25 MB, so I cant put it in source code) where older VMs dont get buried at the bottom (I'd prefer alphabetical or categorical ordering), please explain the new method of organization via an issue in this repo.
