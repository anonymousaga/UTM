# UTM
My UTM virtual machines (that are not found in the gallery).

See releases for released VMs. Each release is a new VM (so no concept of latest/earliest, I will edit a release if it needs changes). They are zipped by Keka (it's a great app!).

Notes on each machine:

 - Windows 95: Internet, sound, mouse, keyboard, clock, and GUI work. The VM does not have seamless transition for mouse. Resolution: 1024 x 768, colored
 - Windows 98 SE: Internet, sound, mouse, keyboard, clock, and GUI work. The VM has seamless transition for mouse. Resolution: 1024 x 768, colored
 - Windows 2000: Internet, sound, mouse, keyboard, clock, and GUI work. The VM has seamless transition for mouse. Resolution: 1024 x 768, colored
 - Windows XP: Internet, sound, mouse, keyboard, clock, and GUI work. The VM has seamless transition for mouse. SPICE/UTM tools have already been installed.
 - Windows 11 ARM: Internet, sound, mouse, keyboard, clock, and GUI work. The VM has seamless transition for mouse. SPICE/UTM tools have already been installed. The VM has been set up with a generic local account, and some bloat has been removed.

If you have any suggestions on better ways to organize this (my zip files will almost always be more than 25 MB, so I cant put it in source code) where older VMs dont get buried at the bottom (I'd prefer alphabetical or categorical ordering), please explain the new method of organization via an issue in this repo.
