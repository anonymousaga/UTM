# UTM

**Note:** I am moving to the Internet Archive! I'll still post documentation here, but VMs that dont fit as a release will instead be linked to the Internet Archive.

My UTM virtual machines (that are not found in the gallery).

See releases for released VMs. Each release is a new VM (so no concept of latest/earliest, I will edit a release if it needs changes). They are zipped by Keka (it's a great app!).

Notes on each machine:

 - Windows 95: Internet, sound, mouse, keyboard, clock, and GUI work. The VM does not have seamless transition for mouse. Resolution: 1024 x 768, colored
 - Windows 98 SE: Internet, sound, mouse, keyboard, clock, and GUI work. The VM has seamless transition for mouse. Resolution: 1024 x 768, colored
 - Windows 2000: Internet, sound, mouse, keyboard, clock, and GUI work. The VM has seamless transition for mouse. Resolution: 1024 x 768, colored
 - Windows ME: Internet, sound, mouse, keyboard, clock, and GUI work. The VM has seamless transition for mouse. Resolution: 1280 x 1024, colored
 - Windows NT 4.0: Internet, mouse, keyboard, clock, and GUI work. Sound does not work. The VM does not have seamless transition. Resolution: 800 x 600, colored.
 - Windows 3.1.1: Sound, mouse, keyboard, and GUI work. The VM Does not have seamless transition. Colored.
 - Windows 3.0: Mouse, keyboard, and GUI work. The VM Does not have seamless transition. Colored.
 - Windows 2.0: Mouse, keyboard, and GUI work. The VM Does not have seamless transition. Colored.
 - Windows 1.0: Mouse, keyboard, and GUI work. The VM Does not have seamless transition. Colored.

If you have any suggestions on better ways to organize this (my zip files will almost always be more than 25 MB, so I cant put it in source code) where older VMs dont get buried at the bottom (I'd prefer alphabetical or categorical ordering), please explain the new method of organization via an issue in this repo.
